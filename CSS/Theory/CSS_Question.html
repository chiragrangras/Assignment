          The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element.<br />Opacity
          is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the
          opposite of transparency.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>How can the background color of an element be changed?</li>
      <p>
        The background-color property of CSS is used to set the background of an
        element.<br />We can set background color by selecting the element by
        its class name of id name and then apply the background-color property
        on it to set the background color.
      </p>
      <li>How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</li>
      <p>
        This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that
        will help us to control the repetition of the image.<br />The
        background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image
        both horizontally and vertically.<br />It also decides whether the
        background image will be repeated or not.
      </p>
      <li>What is the use of the background-position property?</li>
      <p>
        The background-position property sets the starting position of a
        background image. <br />By default, a background-image is placed at the
        top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and
        horizontally.
      </p>
      <li>Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</li>
      <p>
        To set the scrolling of an image in the background, use the
        background-attachment property.
      </p>
      <li>Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</li>
      <p>
        It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a
        complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the
        complexity will further increase.

      <li>How to center block elements using CSS1?</li>
